**Horizon Suite** is a core addon with pluggable modules: **Focus** (objective tracker), **Presence** (zone text & notifications), **Insight** (cinematic tooltips), **Vista** (minimap), and **Yield** (loot toasts). Designed for the Midnight era—clean, cinematic, player-in-control. It replaces static, cluttered lists with a fluid interface that grants you total agency over your goals. Additional suites will appear as modules in the same options panel.

## 🎯 Focus (Objective Tracker)

![Focus - Objective Tracker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crystilac93/Horizon-Suite/main/docs/Focus.gif)

- **Smart zone tracking** – Nearby quests float to the top; list updates as you move. Delves, scenarios, raids, and world events get their own sections with progress bars and timers. Zone event quests appear in Events in Zone before you enter; once you step in, they move to the Current Event section. World quests you're actively doing also appear in Current Event.
- **Track what matters** – Achievements, Endeavors (housing), Decor, Recipes (professions), and Traveler's Log objectives appear in the tracker. Full achievement progress tracking with criteria parsing and quantity strings. One-click to open achievement panel, housing dashboard, decor catalog, or Adventure Guide.
- **Rare boss alerts** – Super-track nearby rares with one click and optional audio alerts.
- **Live quest sync** – World quests, dailies, and weeklies update dynamically. Quests auto-track when you accept them. Choose a radar icon for auto-tracked in-zone entries.
- **Prey section** – Midnight hunting activities (Prey hunts) appear in a dedicated Prey section with distinct colours, separate from weeklies.
- **All The Things integration** – Collection data appears directly in your objectives.
- **Profiles** – Create, switch, copy, and delete named profiles. Per-character, per-specialization, or global (account-wide) modes. Import and export profiles as shareable text strings.
- **Combat-ready** – Show, fade, or hide in combat; show or hide in dungeons/raids/BGs; compact or super-minimal layouts.
- **Show only on mouseover** – Fade the tracker when not hovering; move the mouse over it to reveal.
- **Mythic+ and Delves** – Banner for keystone info, timer, and affixes. Delve objectives in the standard layout.
- **Classic click behaviour** – Optional toggle: left-click opens the quest map, right-click shows share/abandon menu. When off, Ctrl+Right shares the quest with your party.

## 🎬 Presence (Zone Text & Notifications)

![Presence - Zone Text & Notifications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crystilac93/Horizon-Suite/main/docs/Presence.gif)

- **Cinematic notifications** – Replaces Blizzard's default zone text, level-up banner, boss emote frame, and achievement alerts with styled toasts: smooth entrance and exit animations, a dividing line between title and subtitle, and an optional "Discovered!" third line on first visits.
- **Full notification coverage** – Zone entry, subzone changes, level-up, boss emotes, achievements, quest accepted/complete/progress, world quest accepted/complete, scenario start, scenario or delve complete, and scenario or delve objective updates — 13 types in total.
- **Per-type toggles** – Enable or disable each notification type individually. Mythic+ suppression silences zone, quest, and scenario notifications while inside a keystone dungeon.
- **Prioritised queue** – Up to five notifications queue when one is already playing; higher-priority events (level-up, boss emotes, achievements) play ahead of routine quest updates.
- **Visual customisation** – Vertical screen position, frame scale, and independent font types and sizes for title and subtitle. Entrance speed, exit speed, and hold-duration multiplier are all adjustable.

## 🗺️ Vista (Minimap)

![Vista - Minimap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crystilac93/Horizon-Suite/main/docs/Vista.gif)

- **Square or circular minimap** – Choose a square or circular mask. Adjust size (100–400px), lock position, or drag to relocate. Optional auto zoom-out after zooming.
- **Zone text, coordinates, and time** – Zone name, player coordinates, and game time below the minimap. Each element has its own font, size, and colour; show or hide individually. Click the time to open the stopwatch.
- **Instance difficulty** – Difficulty name and Mythic+ keystone level shown when in an instance.
- **Mail and queue indicators** – New mail icon and queue status button appear automatically when relevant.
- **Built-in buttons** – Tracking, calendar, and zoom (+/−) buttons. Show always or on mouseover. Each is draggable and resizable; lock to prevent accidental movement.
- **Addon button collector** – Minimap buttons from other addons are grouped and presented in one of three modes: mouseover bar below the minimap, right-click panel, or floating drawer button. Per-addon filter to show only selected buttons.
- **Customizable appearance** – Border (thickness, colour, opacity), panel background and border colours for button panels, and per-element typography. SharedMedia support for fonts.
- **Mouse wheel zoom** – Scroll over the minimap to zoom in and out.

## 💎 Yield (Loot Toasts) - BETA

![Yield - Loot Toasts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crystilac93/Horizon-Suite/main/docs/Yield.gif)

- **Cinematic loot notifications** – Items, money, currency, and reputation gains appear as styled toasts with quality-based colours and smooth slide-in animations.
- **Epic and legendary flair** – Extra entrance time, shine effects, and optional sounds for high-value loot.

## 🔍 Insight (Tooltips) - BETA

- **Cinematic tooltips** – Dark backdrop, class-colored player names and borders, faction icons, spec/role display, and fade-in animation.
- **Profile-backed settings** – Anchor mode (cursor or fixed) and position stored per profile.

## 🎨 Visuals & UI Design

- **High-fidelity icons** – Distinct icons for Campaign, Legendary, and World Quests.
- **Customizable colours** – Per-category colour control (title, objective, zone, section). Panel backdrop colour and opacity.
- **Scaling** – Global UI scale (50–200%) for all modules, or per-module sliders for Focus, Presence, Vista, Insight, and Yield when WoW UI scale is lowered.
- **Typography and spacing** – Fonts, sizes, outlines, and spacing sliders. Optional SharedMedia support for fonts from addon packs. Turn-in highlights and progress counts (e.g. 15/18) at a glance.
- **Progress bar** – Optional bar under objectives with numeric progress (e.g. 3/250). Configurable font, size, and colours. Filter to show for X/Y objectives (e.g. 3/10), percent-only objectives (e.g. 45%), or both.
- **Fluid motion** – Smooth entry/exit animations and a subtle pulse on objective completion.
- **Scroll indicators** – Optional fade or arrow buttons when the list has more content than visible.
